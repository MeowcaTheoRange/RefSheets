    "description": [
      "Friendly and jovial, Archan is a dedicated and passionate playwright, adapting many archaic and outdated plays into a much easier to preform state. She holds performances to high regard, and finds the current system to be both unnecessary and useless. Uses his position on the hemospectrum to get away with a variety of vaguely treasonous activities, most of which involve severely neglecting her murdering duties in favour of putting on even more plays. Treats all trolls with same respect, and is more than happy to ramble on about the history of theatre if asked. While her goal was initially selfish, simply wanting her rather niche plays to reach a larger audience by ignoring caste restrictions became a genuine compassion for the art and a disregard for the system."
